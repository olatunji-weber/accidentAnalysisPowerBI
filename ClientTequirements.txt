Pimary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
You must understand such things as how to calulate the Total Casualties for the Current Year and how to Calculate the Total Accidents for the Current Year using the TOTALYTD() Function
And you can derive the Year on Year value by using this formula:
(Current Year Vaue - Previous Year Value)/Previous Year Value
CY Casualties = TOTALYTD(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), 'Calendar'[Date])
YoY Casualties = ([CY Casualties] - [PY Casualties])/[PY Casualties]
CY Accidents = TOTALYTD(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]),'Calendar'[Date])
YoY Accidents = ([CY Accidents] - [PY Accidents])/[PY Accidents]
