CUSTOMER REQUIRMENTS:

Client wants to creat a Road Acicent Analysis Dashboard for the year 2021 and 2021 ao that they can have insight on the requirements below:

Pimary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
You must understand such things as how to calulate the Total Casualties for the Current Year and how to Calculate the Total Accidents for the Current Year using the TOTALYTD() Function
And you can derive the Year on Year value by using this formula:
(Current Year Vaue - Previous Year Value)/Previous Year Value
CY Casualties = TOTALYTD(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), 'Calendar'[Date])
YoY Casualties = ([CY Casualties] - [PY Casualties])/[PY Casualties]
CY Accidents = TOTALYTD(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]),'Calendar'[Date])
YoY Accidents = ([CY Accidents] - [PY Accidents])/[PY Accidents]

Primary KPI's - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
In order to do this, we will be using filters because we have calculated the "Total Casualties and Total Accidents already". Now, we need to report the value of the Total Accidents or Total Casualites by Severity such as (Fatal, Serious and Slight)


Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to Vehicle type for Current Year
What we are going to do here is to seperate these types into about 6 different categories by GROUPING them.
And the the various groups will be: (Agricultural, Bike, Bus, Car,  Others, Van)
After the Vehicle types have been categorized by grouping, we can use the "Multiple Row Card" to visualize these data.


Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
You can use the Area Chart in such a way that you have Months on the X axis, Number of Casualties on the Y axis in combination with the Date hierarchy added to the Legends
***But note that you have to create a new Column for the Month Number from the Calender Date, in Data View, then use this newly created Column to Sort the "Month" Column, in order to have the dates formatted in ascending order correctly.


Casualties by Road Type for Current Year


Current Year Casualties by Area / Location and by Day / Night


Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location
