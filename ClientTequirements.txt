CUSTOMER REQUIRMENTS:

Client wants to creat a Road Acicent Analysis Dashboard for the year 2021 and 2021 ao that they can have insight on the requirements below:

Pimary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
You must understand such things as how to calulate the Total Casualties for the Current Year and how to Calculate the Total Accidents for the Current Year using the TOTALYTD() Function
And you can derive the Year on Year value by using this formula:
(Current Year Vaue - Previous Year Value)/Previous Year Value
CY Casualties = TOTALYTD(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), 'Calendar'[Date])
YoY Casualties = ([CY Casualties] - [PY Casualties])/[PY Casualties]
CY Accidents = TOTALYTD(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]),'Calendar'[Date])
YoY Accidents = ([CY Accidents] - [PY Accidents])/[PY Accidents]

Primary KPI's - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
In order to do this, we will be using filters because we have calculated the "Total Casualties and Total Accidents already". Now, we need to report the value of the Total Accidents or Total Casualites by Severity such as (Fatal, Serious and Slight)


Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to Vehicle type for Current Year
What we are going to do here is to seperate these types into about 6 different categories by GROUPING them.
And the the various groups will be: (Agricultural, Bike, Bus, Car,  Others, Van)
After the Vehicle types have been categorized by grouping, we can use the "Multiple Row Card" to visualize these data.


Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
You can use the Area Chart in such a way that you have Months on the X axis, Number of Casualties on the Y axis in combination with the Date hierarchy added to the Legends
***But note that you have to create a new Column for the Month Number from the Calender Date, in Data View, then use this newly created Column to Sort the "Month" Column, in order to have the dates formatted in ascending order correctly.


Casualties by Road Type for Current Year


Current Year Casualties by Area / Location
Use Donut Chart for these. Put the "Urban_or_Rural_Area" measure into the Legend field and the "CY Casualties" into the Values field.

Current Year Casualties by Day / Night
Now, we can duplicate the Donut Chart that we just completed and change out the "Urban_or_Rural_Area" measure with the "Light_Conditions" in the Legend field After we have grouped the "Light_Conditions" into "Dark" and "Day".


Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location
This will be  a Bar chart where we will put the Road Type measure on the Y axis and the CY Casualties on the X axis.

And finally, in order to do the Map Visualization, we will use the Map Chart. First of all bring in the Longitude and the Latitude measures, and select their average options. Then add the "Local_Authority_Distribution" into the Location field.
*** If Map Visuals are disabled in your Power BI application, you can enable it by going to:> File> Options and Settings> Options> Global> Security>
